          <h1>Welcome to the 2022 <br>Chelsea Youth Sail Program! </h1>
          <h2>Registration is now open</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>If you have any difficulties registering, please contact Will at
            <a href="tel:845-453-1764">845-453-1764</a> or <a href="mailto:willg6@gmail.com">willg6@gmail.com</a></p>

          <p>The Chelsea Yacht Club (CYC) Youth Sail Program for youths aged 8 to 17 provides instruction in recreational sailing and sailboat racing with a focus on safety, learning and fun. Youth Sailors build self-confidence and learn lifetime individual and team skills including boat handling, seamanship and water safety. Our U.S. Sailing trained counselors are certified in CPR and basic First Aid. They teach using curricula developed by the US Sailing Association and a variety of sailing dinghies including Optimists and Club 420’s. Each boat is sailed single-handed or by a two or three person team.</p>
          <p>There are six one-week full-day sessions for youths aged 10 to 17 and two one-week half-day sessions for children aged 8 and 9. All participants, especially new sailors, are strongly encouraged to attend a minimum of two consecutive sessions to reinforce their new skills and make the most of their experience. There is a $50.00 ($30 for half-day program) discount for the second and subsequent weeks of participation. Registration for part sessions (part weeks) is not available. All required course materials, including boats, are provided.</p>
          <p>Participants who own an appropriate boat may, with the permission of the Head Instructor, use their own boat in the program. There is a $50 per week discount for participants using their own boat throughout the program.</p>
          <p>Limited scholarships are available. Please contact the Youth Sail Registrar at 845-297-1852 for scholarship information.</p>
