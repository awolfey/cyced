The learn-to-sail courses will be held on Friday night and all day Saturday for two consecutive weekends. The courses are open to adult beginning sailors as well as more experienced sailors. This 20-hour class covers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Environmental and Situational Awareness</li>
            <li>Preparation to Sail</li>

Students will practice their on-the-water skills to gain confidence in operating their vessels. At the end of the course, qualified students will have the option, for an additional fee, of upgrading their experience to challenge the written and practical tests to qualify for the US Sailing Basic Keelboat Certification. This course has a 4:1 student to instructor ratio.</p>
